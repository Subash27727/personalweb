    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
            Gear Up for Innovation:
             A 3rd Year Mechanical Engineer with a Robotics Obsession
I'm a driven and enthusiastic 3rd-year mechanical engineering student with a fire in my belly for designing, modeling, and building robots. The intricate dance between mechanics, electronics, and programming to create these machines that interact with the world fascinates me.

From Textbooks to Tinkercad

My academic journey has provided a solid foundation in core mechanical engineering principles. Courses in statics, dynamics, and materials science have given me the tools to understand the forces at play when robots move. But for me, true learning happens when I can translate theory into practice. That's why I spend countless hours tinkering with  SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor to bring my robotic creations to life in the virtual world.

Building the Future, One Bot at a Time

My passion for robotics extends beyond the classroom. Participating in student robotics competition teams, personal projects has allowed me to hone my skills in robot design, modeling, and control systems development. Each project throws new challenges my way, forcing me to think creatively, troubleshoot problems, and collaborate effectively with teammates.

More Than Just Metal and Circuits

While technical skills are crucial, I believe a successful roboticist needs a well-rounded skillset. My strong work ethic and adaptability have proven invaluable in meeting deadlines and learning new technologies on the fly. My  communication skills, problem-solving abilities ensure smooth collaboration within teams, fostering a positive environment where everyone's ideas are valued.

The Next Chapter Awaits

As I enter my senior year, I'm eager to delve deeper into the world of robotics. I'm particularly interested in the potential of biomimetic robots, AI-powered robots, robots for social good. I believe my academic background, practical experience, and unwavering passion for robots position me to make a real difference in this rapidly evolving field
